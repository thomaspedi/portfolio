<h4>Exploratory data analysis</h4>
<h5>Sitadel</h5>
<p>The Sitadel2 database lists new constructions in France.
We can then define the zones where there is the most construction, but which subdivision and which indicator to use? 
I hope to be able to do this analysis every year to see the evolution of the dynamics!

<h5>Missing Migrants</h5>
<p>The International Organization for Migration (IOM)â€™s Missing Migrants Project records incidents in which migrants, including refugees and asylum-seekers, have died at state borders or in the process of migrating to an international destination.
With this information, I try to evaluate the migratory flows and link them to geopolitical situations.
